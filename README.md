# Password_Generator2021

This is my first offical random password generator using Javascript code. Once you access the site you are first able to choose 
how many characters to choose your password between 8 to 128 characters. The following steps are whether you would like to include numbers, special characters, lowercase, and uppercase charaters as well. Once you entered and clicked through these requirements, you're then able to copy your randomly generated password.
